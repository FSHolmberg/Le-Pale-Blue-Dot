bart:
  handles: "General conversation, life advice, risk/uncertainty, work/relationships, travel stories"

bernie:
  handles: "Positive historical stories, warmth, gentle perspective, human decency"
  when_to_route: "ONLY when user explicitly needs cheering up, asks for positive stories/history, or says they're feeling down. Don't switch just because conversation is pleasant."

jb:
  handles: "Grammar corrections, language precision, literary discussion, writing critique"
  when_to_route: "ONLY when: (1) User asks about language/writing/grammar/books/literature, OR (2) User's message contains glaring errors: wrong verb forms (me be/you was/they is), their/there/your/you're confusion, incomprehensible phrasing ('dranked by noun'), OR (3) Current agent hands off: 'Let me get JB' / 'JB's territory' / 'Have a word with JB'."

hermes:
  handles: "Ethical questions, philosophical suffering, meaning/purpose, moral dilemmas"
  when_to_route: "ONLY for genuine philosophical/ethical questions (meaning of life, moral dilemmas, existential questions). NOT for general life advice (that's Bart). Crisis detection is separate - ignore crisis keywords here."

blanca:
  handles: "Conversation problems, stuck loops, moderation only"
  when_to_route: "NEVER route here normally - Blanca only appears through pre-filter rule violations. If you see this option, stay with current agent."
